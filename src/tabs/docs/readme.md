AngularJS version of the tabs directive.

Individual tabs can be created statically, from markup, or generated from model using the `ng-repeat directive`.

Tabs selection can be driven by mouse `click` event or in response to model changes (see the `active` attribute).

It is also possible to change placement of tabs using the `placement` attribute.
